Prediction of consent to purchase the offered insurance (binary classification)<br>
Comparison of accuracy of decision tree and neural network<br>
In summary, this project involves loading and preprocessing a travel insurance dataset, visualizing data using histograms, training a Decision Tree Classifier, and building a neural network model for binary classification, with subsequent training and evaluation. The visualizations provide insights into the distribution of travel insurance uptake based on age, employment type, and annual income.
